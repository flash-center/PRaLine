README FOR '[PRaLine]/examples/' DIRECTORY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains example intermediate files (test_input.p, test_input.txt) for re-creating some of the plots of Graziani et al. 2017.

More information on using and interpreting these examples can be found in the main documentation for PRaLine, located in the directory above at '[PRaLine]/README.md'.

As described in the main documentation, analysis of the file can be performed via the command line:
   lin-analyze test_input.txt
   lin-reconstruct test_input.txt

The plots generated (after 4000 iterations) after calling these functions should match those in the '[PRaLine]/examples/reference_images' directory.
